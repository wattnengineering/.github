## Organization Code Upload Guidelines
Welcome to Wattn Engineering GitHub repository! To ensure consistency, quality, and maintainability of our codebase, please adhere to the following guidelines when uploading code:


## Branching Strategy

`Main Branch:` The main branch reflects the latest stable version of the project. Only approved and reviewed changes are merged into this branch.

`Feature Branches:` For each new feature or bug fix, create a dedicated branch prefixed with feature/ or bugfix/. Branch names should be descriptive and succinct.

## Commit Guidelines
`Clear and Concise Messages:` Write descriptive commit messages that succinctly describe the changes made. Use present tense and imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" instead of "Added feature").

`Atomic Commits:` Each commit should represent a single logical change. Avoid mixing unrelated changes within a single commit.

`Avoid Committing Sensitive Information:` Do not commit any sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, or personal credentials.

## Code Quality and Standards
`Coding Standards:` Follow the coding standards and style guidelines specified for the project. If no standards are specified, adhere to widely accepted conventions for the programming language being used.

`Documentation:` Document your code thoroughly using comments and docstrings. Document any public interfaces, functions, and classes to make usage clear for other developers.

`Testing:` Write unit tests for your code whenever applicable. Ensure that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.


By following these guidelines, we can maintain a high standard of code quality and collaboration within our organization.
